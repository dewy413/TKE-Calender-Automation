# TKE-Calender-Automation


This was a calendar automation program I created along with a Google Calendar for my fraternity. The idea is that if a member had an event planned they would submit a Google Form, and my script would create an event on the calendar at the click of a button. This is still being used in my chapter, and it allowed me to learn Google Apps Script
