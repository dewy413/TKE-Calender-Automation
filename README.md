# TKE-Calender-Automation


This was a caledner automation program I created along with a Google Calender for my fratierinty. The idea is that if a member had an event planned they would submit a Google Form and my script would create an event on the calender on the click of a button. This is still being used at my chapter and it allowed me to learn appscript.
